## Introduction

In February 2006, a Swedish physician and data advocate named Hans
Rosling gave a famous TED talk titled ["The best stats you've ever
seen"](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen)
where he presented global economic, health, and development data
complied by the Gapminder Foundation.

The talk featured a famous bubble plot similar to this:

![](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sastraining/files/2019/01/wealth_build4-3.png)

A bubble plot is a type of scatter plot where a third dimension is
added: the value of an additional numeric variable is represented
through the size of the points.

We will be using Gapminder data to create a bubble plot with `ggplot2`.

# Packages

To get started, **load in the needed packages**: {tidyverse}, {here},
and {gapminder}.

```{r}
# Load packages
"WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

## Gapminder data

The R package gapminder, which we just loaded, contains global economic,
health, and development data complied by the Gapminder Foundation.

Run the following code to load `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder
package:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Tell R to get the inbuilt dataframe from the package
data(gapminder, package="gapminder")

# Print dataframe
gapminder
```

Each row in this table corresponds to a country-year combination. For
each row, we have 6 columns:

1)  **`country`**: Country name

2)  **`continent`**: Geographic region of the world

3)  **`year`**: Calendar year

4)  **`lifeExp`**: Average number of years a newborn child would live if
    current mortality patterns were to stay the same

5)  **`pop`**: Total population

6)  **`gdpPercap`**: Gross domestic product per person
    (inflation-adjusted US dollars)

The `glimpse()` and `summary()` functions can tell us more about these
variables.

```{r}
# Data structure
glimpse(gapminder)
```

This version of the **`gapminder`** dataset contains information for
**142 countries**, divided in to **5 continents** or world regions.

Data are recorded every 5 years from 1952 to 2007 (a total of 12 years).

```{r}
# Data summary
summary(gapminder)
```

In this lesson, we will be using the `gapminder` dataset , but only the
data from 2007. We can use {dplyr} functions to manipulate the dataset
and prepare it for plotting. Read through the commented code below to
understand how and why these manipulations are done:

```{r}
# Create new data frame called gapminder07
gapminder07 <- gapminder %>%
  # filter data frame to only include rows from 2007
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  # remove the year column
  select(-year) %>%
  # rename columns to make them easier to understand
  rename(life_expectancy = lifeExp,
         population = pop,
         gdp_per_capita = gdpPercap) %>% 
  # reorder dataset by population size (this will be useful later)
  arrange(desc(population))

gapminder07
```

We will start with a regular scatter plot showing the relationship
between two numerical variables, and then make it a bubble plot by
adding a third dimension.

Let's say we want to view the relationship between life expectancy and
GPD per capita. Create a scatter plot, with GPD on the x axis and life
expectancy on the y axis:

```{r}

"WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

Let's view this plot through the grammar of graphics:

1.  The `geom`etric objects - visual marks that represent the data - are
    points.
2.  The `data` variable **gdp_per_capita** gets mapped to the
    `x`-position `aes`thetic of the points.
3.  The `data` variable **life_expectancy** gets mapped to the
    `y`-position `aes`thetic of the points.

What we have created is a simple scatterplot by adding together the
following components:

## Quick detour: Plots as objects

A `ggplot2` graph can be saved as a named R object (like a data frame),
manipulated further, and then printed or saved.

We use the assignment operator to save the plot as an object, just as we
have done with data frames.

```{r}
# create scatterplot and save it
gap_plot_01 <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder07,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdp_per_capita,
    y = life_expectancy)
) +
  geom_point() 

```

This will appear in your environment, but it will **not** be printed. To
print the graph simply type and run the name of the object:

```{r}
"WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"
```

You can add a line of best fit to your scatter plot and save it as a new
plot, without having to write the old code again:

```{r}
gap_plot_02 <- gap_plot_01 + 
  geom_smooth()
```

## Bubble plots with `geom_point()`

With {ggplot2}, bubble plots are built using the `geom_point()`
function. At least three arguments must be provided to `aes()`: `x`, `y`
and `size`.

So let's add an additional variable, `population`, and map it to the
size aesthetic.

```{r}
gapminder_bubble <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder07,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdp_per_capita,
    y = life_expectancy,
    size = population)) +
  geom_point()

gapminder_bubble
```

Here, the population of each country is represented through point size.
The legend will automatically be built by {ggplot2}, showing how point
size scales with population size.

Many of the points are overlapping, so we can decrease the opacity of
the points: Change the opacity of the points to 50%.

```{r}
gapminder_plot_03 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"

gapminder_plot_03
```

## Modifying scales

One of the optional grammar of graphics layers that we haven't learned
about yet is `scale_*()` functions.

![](images/gg_min_build2.png)

In this section, you can simply run the code we've already written for
you. We will use two new scale functions.

### Control point size with `scale_size()`

The first thing we need to improve on the previous bubble plot is the
size range of the bubbles. `scale_size()` allows to set the size of the
smallest and the biggest point using the `range` argument.

```{r}
gapminder_plot_04 <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder07,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdp_per_capita,
    y = life_expectancy,
    size = population
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 20))

gapminder_plot_04
```

## Log transform scales

(Add that section from line graphs lesson and adapt it to this data.)

We can address this by log-transforming the y-axis using
`scale_x_log10()`, which log-scales the x-axis (as the name suggests).
We will add this function as a new layer after a `+` sign, as usual:

```{r}
gapminder_plot_06 <- ggplot(
  data = gapminder07,
  mapping = aes(
    x = gdp_per_capita,
    y = life_expectancy,
    size = population
  )
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size(range = c(1, 20)) +
  scale_x_log10()

gapminder_plot_06
```

## Adding a fourth dimension: color

Since we have one more variable in our dataset (`continent`) , why not
showing it using point color? Modify the previous code to map the
`continent` variable the `color` mapping:

```{r}
gapminder_plot_07 <- "WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"

gapminder_plot_07
```

This produced a bubble plot displaying all the information from the four
variables in our data frame.

Let's again view this plot through the grammar of graphics. The first
three components are the same as the last plot, but now we have added
two additional `aes`thetic mappings.

1.  The `geom`etric objects - visual marks that represent the data - are
    points.
2.  The `data` variable **gdp_per_capita** gets mapped to the
    `x`-position `aes`thetic of the points.
3.  The `data` variable **life_expectancy** gets mapped to the
    `y`-position `aes`thetic of the points.
4.  The `data` variable **population** gets mapped to the `size`
    `aes`thetic of the points.
5.  The `data` variable **continent** gets mapped to the `color`
    `aes`thetic of the points.

We built upon the simple scatterplot by adding variable colors and
sizes: ![](images/ggplot_intro2.png){width="509"}
